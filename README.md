# Bayesian model selection with random effects

Extends upon the work by Naqvi et al, Fast Laplace Approximation for Sparse Bayesian Spike and Slab Models [link](https://approximateinference.org/archives/2015/accepted/NaqviEtAl2015.pdf)

Builds upon original work by inclusion of random effects to adjust for posterior inclusion probability uncertainty

See [DESCRIPTION.pdf](https://github.com/danielcgingerich/bayesian_model_selection/blob/main/DESCRIPTION.pdf) for model details
